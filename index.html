      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h3>Christians worship one God in three persons--the Father, the Son (i.e., Jesus) and the Holy Spirit.</h3>
      <p>They do so because God has clearly revealed the doctrine of the Holy Trinity in the inspired Scriptures. They don't accept the doctrine of the Trinity just because it "feels right" to them or because of a decree from some pope or church council. Rather, they believe and cherish the truth of who God is because God has made it known in the Bible.</p>
      <p>The doctrine is summed up in the statement that God is one being in three fully-divine persons. This definition is a summary of seven fundamental tenets, each clearly revealed in the Scriptures:</p>
      <ul class="tenets">
        <li>There is but one God.</li>
        <li>The Father is <abbr title="i.e., fully divine">God</abbr>.</li>
        <li>The Son is God.</li>
        <li>The Holy Spirit is God.</li>
        <li>The Father is not the Son.</li>
        <li>The Son is not the Holy Spirit.</li>
        <li>The Holy Spirit is not the Father.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>To reject any one of these basic truths is to reject God and His self-revelation.</h3>
      <p>Christians have always condemned the rejection of any one of these seven biblical points as damnable heresy. If you reject the first tenet (i.e., Monotheism: "There is but one God"), you end up embracing atheism or a form of polytheism. The rejection of any of points 2-4 (i.e., Co-equality of the persons: "The Father is God," "The Son is God," "The Holy Spirit is God") leads to some variation of the ancient heresy of Arianism, which is the belief that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are not fully equal to God the Father. Finally, to dismiss any one of the last three points (i.e., Distinction of the persons: "The Father is not the Son," "The Son is not the Holy Spirit," "The Holy Spirit is not the Father") is to identify with some form of the ancient heresy of modalism.
      <p>This page presents some of the key biblical texts that most clearly illustrate these essential truths that undergird the doctrine of the Holy Trinity.</p>
      <h3>The doctrine of the Trinity goes beyond human reason--but is not <em>against</em> reason.</h3>
      <p> Christians do not believe that 1 + 1 + 1 = 1. Rather, they acknowledge one divine being in three persons: one <em>what</em> in three <em>who's</em>. The categorical distinction between being and personhood is one that you use every day: a pebble has being but lacks personhood; but humans have both being and personhood.</p>
      <h3>The Bible is not a textbook of Systematic Theology.</h3>
      <p>God revealed His Tri-unity during the <abbr title="i.e., between Malachi and Matthew/Mark">inter-testamental period</abbr> of history: specifically, in the <abbr title="i.e., when God the Son took on a human nature">Incarnation</abbr> and at <abbr title="i.e., the coming of the Holy Spirit">Pentecost</abbr>. Therefore, the New Testament authors did not lay out the doctrine of the Trinity in a step-by-step manner such as the seven-point outline here. Instead, they conveyed their recognition of God's Tri-unity as it related to their specific narrative or didactic purposes.</p><p>The following texts illustrate some of the ways that the biblical authors included the seven basic points of Trinitarian doctrine in their writings.</p>
